## Project Overview

The voice assistant is designed to:
- Process and understand voice commands.
- Perform a variety of tasks such as providing weather updates, setting reminders, answering general knowledge questions, and more.
- Utilize NLP techniques for command interpretation and speech recognition for processing voice input.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands and interprets user commands.
- **Task Execution**: Performs tasks such as web searches, providing weather updates, setting alarms, and more.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to users with spoken language.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd voice-assistant
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary API keys for services like weather updates, web search, etc., and add them to your environment variables or a configuration file.

## Usage

1. Run the voice assistant script:
    ```bash
    python voice_assistant.py
    ```

2. Speak to the voice assistant and issue commands. For example, you can ask:
    - "What's the weather like today?"
    - "Set a reminder for 3 PM."
    - "Tell me a joke."

## Project Structure
